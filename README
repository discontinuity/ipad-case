This is an ipad 1 case made for cutting on a laser cutter. The file was made in inkscape with two layers: one for cutting and one for etching. I appear to have lost later iterations of the file and the gcode, but the gcode would've been specific to our laser anyway.
Material recommendations: 3/16" plywood, sold as underlay in Canada.
